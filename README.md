# Traffic Queue Simulator Project

**Assignment**: Assignment #1 - Implementing Queue for solving the traffic light problem  
**Student Name**: Tamanna Katuwal
**Roll Number**: 36
**Date**: Dec 2025  

## 1. Summary of Work
This project simulates a smart traffic junction management system using Python and Pygame. It addresses the "Traffic Light Problem" by implementing a fair **Normal Condition** scheduling algorithm for regular flow and a specialized **Priority Queue** mechanism for high-traffic scenarios on Lane A.

## 2. Key Features
- **Traffic Generator**: Simulates realistic vehicle arrivals.
- **Priority Scheduling**: Handles high-traffic lanes with priority override.
- **Fair Dispatch**: Ensures other lanes get fair green time based on waiting vehicles.

## 3. How to Run
1. Generate Traffic: `python traffic_generator.py`
2. Run Simulation: `python simulator.py`
